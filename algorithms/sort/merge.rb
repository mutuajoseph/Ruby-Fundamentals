# Mergesort: A stable divide-and-conquer sort that sorts small chunks of the
# container and then merges them together. Returns an array of the sorted
# elements. Requirements: Container should implement []
# Time Complexity: О(n log n) average and worst-case
# Space Complexity: О(n) auxiliary
# Stable: Yes
