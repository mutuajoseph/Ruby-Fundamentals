# Selection sort: A naive sort that goes through the container and selects the
# smallest element, putting it at the beginning. Repeat until the end is reached.
# Requirements: Needs to be able to compare elements with <=>, and the [] []=
# methods should be implemented for the container.
# Time Complexity: О(n^2)
# Space Complexity: О(n) total, O(1) auxiliary
# Stable: Yes
