# Fibers are primitives for implementing light weight cooperative concurrency in
# Ruby. Basically they are a means of creating code blocks that can be paused
# and resumed, much like threads. The main difference is that they are never
# preempted and that the scheduling must be done by the programmer and not the VM.

require 'fiber'

f = Fiber.new do |value|
  first = value
  puts "first call fiber with args: #{first ? first : 'not passed'}"
  second = Fiber.yield
  puts "second call fiber with args: #{second ? second : 'not passed'}"
  other = Fiber.yield
  puts "First: #{first}, Second: #{second}, Other: #{other ? other : 'not passed'}"
  puts 'Last call'
end

f.resume('First argument')
f.resume('Second argument')
f.resume
# f.resume call error if try call one more time fiber is dead
