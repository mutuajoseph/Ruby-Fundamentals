# Don't rescue Exception, rescue StandardError
# Before Explicitly rescuing Exception will rescue even not normally recoverable
# errors such as SyntaxError, LoadError, and Interrupt.

begin
  foo
rescue Exception => e
  logger.warn "Unable to foo, will ignore: #{e}"
end

# Refactor
# If you omit the Exception type qualifier, then Ruby will catch only
# StandardError, which is probably what  you want:

begin
  foo
rescue StandardError => e
  logger.warn "Unable to foo, will ignore: #{e}"
end
