# Symbols != strings. Even if the same when printed. Remember which one to use
# for what (args).Ideally, take either, and use what a method expects: "Be
# liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send."  (Postel's Law)

str = "string"
sym = :string

puts str
# => string

puts sym
# => string

str == sym
