# Evaluate a block in the context of a class
# Similar to re-opening a class but more flexible in that it
# works on any variable that references a class, where as re-opening
# a class requires defining a constant.

# Classic class re-opening style
class String
  def m
    puts 'hello!'
  end
end

# Class eval style
# The extra code is used to make the example a bit more re-usable/abstracted

    def m
