# Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal
# state allowing the object to be restored to this state later.

# The Originator can save and load itself. The Caretaker (the main function in
# this case) never has to touch the memento objects.

# This implementation is a bit naive:
# - saves should be kept in files
# - Marshal will not always work (singleton methods, bindings, etc..)
